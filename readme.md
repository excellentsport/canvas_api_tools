## CanvasAPIplay

A place to store anything related to my experiments with the Canvas API

"canvas_ungraded_to_todoist.py" adds ungraded Canvas items to my Todoist inbox (I have it deployed on Pipedream to run once every 24 hours). 

"fullpointsifsubmitted.py" does what it says, but it's mostly useless.

"essay_grader.py" was going to be a tool to let me grade essay questions for Canvas exams faster than the web app does, but I'm moving away from that now due to the ubiquity of LLMs. It'll probably stay abandoned.
